Program no: 2

In this program we are using compostion to achive the funtionality of loosely coupling.

Drawback:
- Using this Java Project if we want to give more funtinality to our Drivable class then we have to modify our code that is not right for production environment
  because when we want any new funtionality like i want a feature of Automatic Driving so we have to change our code that's mean our class is tightly 
  coupled with each other so using this we can't do it.
  
 Solution: Refer "01-StrategyDP(Vehicle(Use case-3)using interface (solution))" java project to solve the above problem
